First of all let me start off with: React and redux are amazing. I have reasons that I can back up with evidence about why they are so awesome, but lets do that one at a time.

## So, Why is react awesome?

Let me just list off a bunch of reasons and then I'll delve into further detail on each of them.

1. You probably already know it!
2. It is super easy to begin with.
3. It makes developing webapps fun.
4. It makes sense.

## 1. You probably already know it!

It uses the JSX syntax which provides a bit of sugar on top of JS that allows you to write XML like code in your javascript

```js
class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className='myclass'>
        this is valid js with JSX
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
