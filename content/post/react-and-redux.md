First of all let me start off with: React and redux are amazing. I have reasons that I can back up with evidence about why they are so awesome, but lets do that one at a time.

## So, Why is react awesome?

Let me just list off a bunch of reasons and then I'll delve into further detail on each of them.

* You probably already know it!
* It is super easy to begin with.
* It makes developing webapps fun.
* It makes sense.

## 1. You probably already know it!

It uses the JSX syntax which provides a bit of sugar on top of JS that allows you to write XML like code in your javascript

```js
class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className='myclass'>
        this is valid js with JSX
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
